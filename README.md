DCI Javascript project (shopping cart)


Description: 
- Shopping cart functionality is essential for eCommerce websites.
  It allows users to add items to their cart, view the contents, and manage them before proceeding to checkout.

  
Shopping Cart Functionality:
- Add to Cart:
  Users can add products to their cart while browsing.
  
- View Cart:
  A dedicated cart page displays the added items with details.
  
- Quantity Adjustment:
  Users can change the quantity or remove items.
  
- Total Calculation:
  The cart calculates the total cost of items.
  
- Checkout:
  Users can easily proceed to the checkout process.


Implementation Considerations: 
- I would like to create a command-line application that simulates the shopping cart functionality,
  allowing users to add, remove, and view items. This can serve as a demonstration of my project's functionality and how it would work on a website.
